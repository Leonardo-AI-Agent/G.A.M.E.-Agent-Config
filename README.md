- **Short-term goals:** Tasks the agent performs daily, such as checking wallet balances or gathering trending topics on X.
- **Long-term goals:** Strategic objectives, like achieving economic independence and generating consistent revenue through token trades or selling 3D models.

### 3. **Agent World**
This defines the environment the agent interacts with:
- **Platforms:** Examples include blockchain networks, X (formerly Twitter), and Sketchfab.
- **Resources:** APIs, tools for 3D model creation, and data retrieval systems.
- **Limitations:** Includes daily API rate limits and platform-specific restrictions.
